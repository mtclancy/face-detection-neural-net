I've posted or presented on a number of AI topics over the last few years from training a computer vision model 
to detect an open baby gate, to a job recruiting agent with facial recognition, to my most recent post on clustering
political opinions.  In short, I've done a lot of work with technology that leverages neural networks in some form or another.
But if you were to have asked me to explain in detail how a neural net works, I would have been a deer in headlights.
I finally decided to scratch that itch, and challenged myself to build a simple neural network from scratch, using only typescript.
No external packages that do the heavy lifting.  I won't say that I am now an expert in neural nets, but I finally feel like I understand
what is happening under the hood.  

Harkening back to my teaching days, I'll borrow from the old addage that the best way to learn something is to teach it.

The Plan
Build and train a simple neural network that can detect face from a 10 by 10 pixel image, using only Typescript (and a few Node utilities for working with csv's).

Neural Networks from 10,000 Feet

Node
The building blocks of a neural network.  A node contains one to many Weights, which can be thought of as an array of numbers.
These numbers start out random but will change as our node is trained.  Getting these weights right will be critical to building a network
that can accurately detect a face.

Example weights
[0.1, -0.23, 0.5, -0.8, ...]

Inputs
Nodes can make a prediction by applying their weights to an equally sized group of external inputs.

Layer
A group of nodes that process the same inputs. Each node in a layer will
